# Quick Dates

This is a plugin for Obsidian that is designed to reduce as much friction as possible between you and daily notes (whether linking or opening), or just date formatting in general.

## Highlights

⭐ Powerful, responsive, and informative inline suggester that supports multiple insertion modes (link, plain text, alternate formats, timestamps, etc.) using modifier keys, and even open the selected daily note from here.

Just type `qd` (customizable in settings) to get started:

<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="assets/convert-all-demo.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

⭐ Intelligent conversion of plain text to daily note links (or any other format you desire):

<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="assets/convert-individual-demo.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

⭐ Scan and convert entire markdown documents with different date formats, relative time phrases, etc.
